These elaborate displays involve males inflating air sacs, fanning tail feathers, and producing distinctive popping sounds to attract females.</p><p>Lek viewing requires early morning arrival and careful observation from appropriate distances to avoid disturbing the birds. The displays typically occur during a relatively short window in early spring, making timing critical for observers.</p>",
